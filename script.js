              <h4>
              This book holds a special place in my heart. Each time I read it, it feels like I'm discovering it all over again. I find myself uncovering new layers of meaning that I had previously overlooked. My interpretations have evolved with each read, influenced by how I've changed as a person over the years. I noticed that different sections began to stand out, resonating with the new perspectives and understanding I had gained. </h4>
              <h4>Seneca's words are as relevant today as they were when he wrote them. This book contains 124 letters written by the Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca to his friend and disciple, Lucilius. A must-read for anyone interested in stoicism, philosophy, or simply seeking a deeper understanding of how to live a meaningful life.
              </h4>
              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>You should neither become like the bad because they are many, nor be an enemy of the many because they are unlike you. Retire into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are capable of improving. The process is mutual one: men learn as they teach.</p>
              <p>Happy the man who improves other people not merely when he is in their presence but even when he is in their thoughts! And happy, too, is he who can so improve himself as not to be thrown into confusion by the thoughts of others.</p>
              <p>Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face as mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval.</p>
              <p>If you shape your life according to nature, you will never be poor; if according to people's opinions, you will never be rich. Nature's wants are small, while those of opinion are limitless.</p>
              <p>Do you think you are the only person to have had this experience? Are you really surprised, as if it were something unprecedented, that so long a tour and such diversity of scene have not enabled you to throw off this melancholy and this feeling of depression?</p>
              <p>How can you wonder your travels do you no good, when you carry yourself around with you? You are saddled with the very thing that drove you away.</p>
              <p>All that dashing about turns out to be quite futile. And if you want to know why all this running away cannot help you, the answer is simply this: you are running away in your own company.</p>
              <p>We should all live with the conviction: "I wasn't born for one particular corner; the whole world's my home country."</p>
              <p>For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. So - to the best of your ability - demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all the evidence against yourself. Play the part first of prosecutor, then judge and finally of pleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times. </p>
              <p>A woman is not beautiful when her ankle or arm wins compliments, but when her total appearance diverts admiration from the individual parts of her body. </p>
              <p>No one should feel pride in anything that is not his own. Suppose he has a beautiful home and a handsome collection of servants, a lot of land under cultivation and a lot of money out at interest; not one of those things can be said to be in him - they are just things around him. Praise in him what can neither be given nor snatched away, what is peculiarly a man's.</p>
              <p>Show me a man who isn't a slave; one is a slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear.</p>
              <p>What in fact makes people who are morally unenlightened upset by the experience of physical distress is their failure to acquire their habit of contentment with the spirit. They have instead been preoccupied by the body. That is why a man of noble and enlightened character separates body from spirit and has just as much to do with the former, the frail and complaining part of our nature, as is necessary and no more, and a lot to do with the better, the divine element.</p>
              <p>So long as you carry the sources of your troubles about with you, those troubles will continue to harass and plague you wherever you wander on land or on sea. Does it surprise you that running away doesn't do you any good? The things you're running away from are with you all the time.</p>
              <p>If you wish to be stripped of your vices you must get right away from the examples others set of them. The miser, the swindler, the bully, the cheat, who would do you a lot of harm by simply being near you, are actually within you. Move to better company.</p>
              <p>People who know no self-restraint lead stormy and disordered lives, passing their time in a state of fear commensurate with the injuries they do to others, never able to relax. After every act they tremble, paralyzed, their consciences continually demanding an answer, not allowing them to get on with other things. To expect punishment is to suffer it; and to earn it is to expect it. A guilty person sometimes has the luck to escape detection, but never to feel sure of it.</p>
              <p>No man's good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt. Pleasure is a poor and petty thing. No value should be set on it: it's something we share with dumb animals - the minutest and most insignificant creatures scutter after it. Glory's an empty, changeable thing, as fickle as the weather. Poverty's no evil to anyone unless he kicks against it. Death is not an evil. What is it then? The one law mankind has that is free of all discrimination. Superstition is an idiotic heresy: it fears those it should love: it dishonors those it worships. For what difference does it make whether you deny the gods or bring them into disrepute?</p>
              <p>Philosophy has no business to supply vice with excuses; a sick man who is encouraged to live in a reckless manner by his doctor has not a hope of getting well.</p>

              <h4>
              As the title suggests, this book is all about love—familial, platonic, romantic, and self-love. Bell Hooks explores how love is hindered by patriarchy, capitalism, and gender roles. She challenges conventional views and advocates for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to relationships.
              </h4>
              <h4>
              To be honest, I've owned this book for a couple of years, but haven't finished it until now. While Hooks' exploration of love is digestible and insightful, I found it be somewhat generic at times. The discussions on intersectionality, which I hoped would provide a deeper perspective, were limited. However, the book's critique of societal norms and its call for love ethics are thought-provoking and valuable. It's a worthwhile read for those interested in how societal structures affect our understanding of love.
              </h4>
              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>It is easier to articulate the pain of love's absence than to describe its presence and meaning in our lives.</p>
              <p>Everywhere we learn that love is important, and yet we are bombarded by its failure. </p>
              <p>Everyone assumes that we will know how to love instinctively. Those of us who do not learn how to love among family are expected to experience love in romantic relationships. However, this love often eludes us. And we spend a lifetime undoing the damage cause by cruelty, neglect, and all manner of lovelessness experienced in our families of origin and in relationships where we simply did not know what to do. </p>
              <p>To my child's mind love was the good feeling you got when  family treated you like you mattered. Love was always and only about good feeling.</p>
              <p>Loving justice between a man and a woman does not stand a chance when other men's manhood matters more. When a man has decided to love manhood more than justice, there are predictable consequences in all his relationships with women. </p>
              <p>Learning to live as a man of conscience means deciding that your loyalty to the people whom you love is always more important than whatever lingering loyalty you may sometimes feel to other men's judgement on your manhood. </p>
              <p>Male fantasy is seen as something that can create reality, whereas female fantasy is regarded as pure escape. Men often write about love through fantasy, through what they imagine is possible rather than what they concretely know.</p>
              <p>Spiritual life is first and foremost about commitment to a way of thinking and behaving that honors principles of inter-being and interconnectedness. </p>
              <p>All other spiritual teachings are in vain if we cannot love. Anyone who does not know love is still in death. All awakening to love is spiritual awakening.</p>
              <p>To return to love, to get the love we always wanted but never had, to have the love we want but are not prepared to give, we seek romantic relationships. We believe these relationships, more than any other, will rescue and redeem us. True love does have the power to redeem but only if we are ready for redemption. Love saves us only if we want to be saved.</p>

              <h4>
              To put it simply, I liked this book a lot. Emily Ratajkowski is brutally honest in this collection of self-reflective, intimate, personal essays. She discusses the commodification of her body throughout her career as a model, grappling with her own beauty and objectification in a patriarchal & capitalistic world. She is open about how the objectification of her body has financially benefited her and brought her fame, but she's never considered it true empowerment. </h4>
              <h4>
              The book is full of contradictions, and honestly, it's why I found it so compelling. Emily doesn't present a black-and-white view or gloss over her experiences and choices. Instead, she shares a nuanced and complex relationship with her mind and body, much like the rest of us. 
              </h4>

              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>It had never occurred to me that the women who gained their power from beauty were indebted to the men whose desire granted them that power in the first place. Those men were the ones in control, not the women the world fawned over. Facing the reality of the dynamics at play would have meant admitting how limited my power really was—how limited any woman's power is when she survives and even succeeds in the world as a thing to be looked at</p>
              <p>I know that embracing anger means relinquishing that control, that assessment, that distance from myself, but I am desperate for control. I would rather hurt myself--metaphorically stab myself--than let anyone else hold the knife.</p>
              <p>I do remember that as a young girl I prayed for beauty. I'd lie in bed, squeeze my eyes shut, and concentrate so hard that I broke out in a sweat underneath the covers. I believed that for God to take you seriously, you had to make your mind as blank as possible and then focus on the expanding spots of light behind your eyelids and think only of the one thing you desperately wished for.</p>
              <p>I think of her and the other naked women who line the walls and fill the halls of museums, some so ancient the color has washed from their bodies and their marble heads have fallen off. It would be easy to mistake these displays for symbols of respect, for an honor. But what were their lives? And what were their names? no one remembers.</p>
              <p>The world celebrates and rewards women who are chosen by powerful men.</p>
              <p>I read once that women are more likely than men to cry when they are angry. I know that women cry out of shame. We are afraid of our anger, embarrassed by the way that it transforms us. We cry to quell what we feel, even when it's trying to tell us something, even when it has every right to exist.</p>
              <p>I wonder how many women you've disregarded in your life, written off, because you assumed they had nothing to offer beyond the way they looked. How quickly they learned that the stuff in their heads was of less value than the shape of their bodies.</p>
              <p>How funny that men view the life cycles of women so simply! From sex object to mother to what? Invisibility?</p>
              <p>I thought of my mother's belief that spaces hold memories, that walls take on meaning, that homes become a part of us, just as people do...I wondered whether the more I became a woman and the more space I occupied apart from her, the more she would deteriorate.</p>
              <p>I so desperately craved men's validation that I accepted it even when it came wrapped in disrespect.</p>
              <p>I will proclaim all of my mistakes and contradictions, for all the women who cannot do so, for all the women we've called muses without learning their names, whose silence we mistook for consent. I stood on their shoulders to get here.</p>
              <p>I want to calculate my beauty to protect myself, to understand exactly how much power and lovability I have.</p>

              <h4>
              Dostoevsky offers an exploration of the human psyche, themes of despair, consciousness, and the nature of reality. The narrator is an isolated and bitter man. He finds pleasure in his own suffering, and the intense awareness of his hopelessness. His high self-standards lead him to loathe himself and assume others feel the same. </h4>
              <h4>
              I enjoyed this book for several reasons. The narrator's raw and honest introspection provided a unique perspective on self-awareness and the paradoxes of human consciousness. He's dislikable, bitter & selfish, yet shockingly relatable at times. Dostoevsky’s intense portrayal of human nature is what makes this book so compelling. It’s a challenging read, but a book I’d love to read again.</h4>


              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>The pleasure of despair. But then, it is in despair that we find the most acute pleasure, especially when we are aware of the hopelessness of the situation... everything is a mess in which it is impossible to tell what's what, but that despite this impossibility and deception it still hurts you, and the less you can understand, the more it hurts.</p>
              <p>How can a man of consciousness have the slightest respect for himself?</p>
              <p>I tell you solemnly, that I have many times tried to become an insect. But I was not equal even to that. I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness- a real thorough-going illness.</p>
              <p>It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone.</p>
              <p>I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.</p>
              <p>But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure? Answer: Of himself. Well, so I will talk about myself.</p>
              <p>It was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.</p>
              <p>In despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one's position.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?</p>
              <p>In every man’s memories there are such things as he will reveal not to everyone, but perhaps only to friends. There are also such as he will reveal not even to friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort.</p>
              <p>For goodness sake,' they'll cry, 'you cannot argue against it--two times two is four! Nature doesn't consult you; it doesn't give a damn for your wishes or whether its laws please or do not please you. You must accept it as it is, and hence accept all consequences. A wall is indeed a wall. ...' And so on and so forth. Good God, what do I care about the laws of nature and arithmetic if, for one reason or another, I don't like these laws, including the 'two times two is four'? Of course, I cannot break through this wall with my head if I don't have the strength to break through it, but neither will I accept it simply because I face a stone wall and am not strong enough.</p>
              <p>Dreams, as we all know, are very curious things: certain incidents in them are presented with quite uncanny vividness, each detail executed with the finishing touch of a jeweller, while others you leap across as though entirely unaware of, for instance, space and time. Dreams seem to be induced not by reason but by desire, not by the head but by the heart, and yet what clever tricks my reason has sometimes played on me in dreams!</p>
              <p>They did not strive to gain knowledge of life as we strive to understand it, because their lives were full. But their knowledge was higher and deeper than the knowledge we derive from our science; for our science seeks to explain what life is and strives to understand it in order to teach others how to live, while they knew how to live without science.</p>
              <p>Oh, these people were not concerned whether I understood them or not; they loved me without it. But I knew too that they would never be able to understand me, and for that reason I hardly ever spoke to them of it.</p>
              <p>I was overpowered by the mere sensation of that dream and it alone survived in my sorely wounded heart.</p>
              <p>So much have we lost touch with 'real life' that we occasionally feel a kind of disgust for it and so can't bear to be reminded of it. For we have arrived at the point where we look on 'real life' as toil, almost as compulsory service, and all of us privately agree that 'life' as we find it in book is better.</p>

              <h4>This book really made me think about how I perceive art. It made me realize that the way I see paintings — and really, all images — is influenced by societal norms that I hadn’t fully recognized before. The book pushed me to think critically about how images are used, not just in art but in all forms of visual media, to convey messages and ideologies.</h4>
              <h4>One of my favorite quotes overall and from the book is, “To be desired is perhaps the closest anybody in this life can reach to feeling immortal.” This line struck me. It’s a reflection on how being seen by others can grant us a sense of transcending mortality, even if it is only for a fleeting moment, which I found simply beautiful. </h4>
              <h4>
              I like that the book talks about the portrayal of women in art, particularly how they’re often depicted as objects of the male gaze. Berger discusses how women have historically been portrayed in ways that emphasize their appearance and desirability, and shaping their identity through the eyes of others. I found it necessary because it is a reality often glossed over or ignored in discussions about art and media. There is a documentary that you can watch, which was adapted into this book <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXl4U1gFTto&t=239s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue;"> here.</a>
              </h4>
              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>The uniqueness of every painting was once part of the uniqueness of the place where it resided. Sometimes the painting was transportable. But it could never be seen in two places at the same time. When the camera reproduces a painting, it destroys the uniqueness of its image. As a result its meaning changes. Or, more exactly, its meaning multiplies and fragments into many meanings.</p>
              <p>The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.</p>
              <p>For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free. They surround us in the same way as a language surrounds us. They have entered the mainstream of life over which they no longer, in themselves, have power. Yet very few people are aware of what has happened because the means of reproduction are used nearly all the time to promote the illusion that nothing has changed except that the masses, thanks to reproductions, can now begin to appreciate art as the cultured minority once did. Understandably, the masses remain uninterested and skeptical.</p>
              <p>A man's presence suggests what he is capable of doing to you or for you. By contrast, a woman's presence . . . defines what can and cannot be done to her.</p>
              <p>A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. Whilst she is walking across a room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. And so she comes to consider the surveyor and the surveyed within her as the two constituent yet always distinct elements of her identity as a woman. She has to survey everything she is and everything she does because how she appears to men, is of crucial importance for what is normally thought of as the success of her life. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another.</p>
              <p>One might simplify this by saying: men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object -- and most particularly an object of vision: a sight.</p>
              <p>To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself.</p>
              <p>To remain innocent may also be to remain ignorant.</p>
              <p>When in love, the sight of the beloved has a completeness which no words and no embrace can match: a completeness which only the act of making love can temporarily accommodate.</p>
              <p>Women constantly meet glances which act like mirrors reminding them of how they look or how they should look. Behind every glance there is judgment.</p>
              <p>The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman. The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.</p>
              <p>You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, you put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting "Vanity", thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure.</p>
              <p>Oil painting did to appearances what capital did to social relations. It reduced everything to the equality of objects. Everything became exchangeable because everything became a commodity.</p>
              <p>Works of art in earlier tradition celebrated wealth. But wealth was then a symbol of a fixed social or divine order. Oil painting celebrated a new kind of wealth - which was dynamic and which found its only sanction in the supreme buying power of money. Thus painting itself had to be able to demonstrate the desirability of what can be bought lies in its intangibility, in how it will reward touch, the hand, of the owner.</p>
              <p>Every woman's presence regulates what is and is not 'permissible' within her presence. Every one of her actions - whatever its direct purpose or motivation - is also read as an indication of how she would like to be treated. If a woman throws a glass on the floor, this is an example of how she treats her own emotion of anger and so of how she would wish it to be treated by others. If a man does the same, his action is only read as an expression of his anger. If a woman makes a good joke this is an example of how she treats the joker in herself and accordingly of how she as a joker-woman would like to be treated by others. Only a man can make a good joke for its own sake.</p>
              <p>Money is life. Not in the sense that without money you starve. Not in the sense that capital gives one class power over the entire lives of another class. But in the sense that money is the token of, and the key to, every human capacity. The power to spend money is the power to live.</p>
              <p>The real question is: to whom does the meaning of the art of the past properly belong ? To those who can apply it to their own lives, or to a cultural hierarchy of relic specialists?</p>
              <p>This is not to say that before the invention of the camera men believed that everyone could see everything. But perspective organized the visual field as though that was indeed the ideal. Every drawing or painting that used perspective proposed to the spectator that he was the unique centre of the world. The camera - and more particularly the movie camera - demonstrated that there was no centre.</p>

              <h4>Martyr was one of my most anticipated reads of 2024, and it did not disappoint. A captivating read that blends family history, loss, and identity. Cyrus Shams, a poet struggling with addiction, is haunted by his mother’s death in a plane crash and his father’s hard life working in a chicken factory. The story moves between Cyrus’s search for meaning in the present and his family’s past, diving into the lives of his mother, father, and uncle, who served in the Iranian army as the Angel of Death. Akbar’s writing is sharp and poignant, with so many lines that hit hard. Akbar really knows how to pull you in and make you feel the weight of every moment. </h4>
              <h3>NOTES:</h3>
              <p>You write a fact in a book and there it sat until someone born five hundred years later improved it. Refined it, implemented it more usefully. Easy. You couldn't do that with soul-learning. We started from zero. From less than zero, actually. We started whiny, without grace. Obsessed with our own needing. And the dead could't teach us anything about that. No facts or tables or proofs. You just had to live and suffer and then teach your kids to do the same. From a distance, habit passing for happiness. </p>
              <p>Living happened until it didn't. There was no choice in it. To say no to a new day would be unthinkable. So each morning you said yes, then stepped into the consequence.</p>
              <p>It seems very American to expect grief to change something. Like a token you cash in. A formula. Grieve x amount, receive y amount of comfort. Work a day in the grief mines and get paid in tickets to the company store.</p>
              <p>If the mortal sin of the suicide is greed, to hoard stillness and calm for yourself while dispersing your riotous internal pain among all those who survive you, then the mortal sin of the martyr must be pride, the vanity, the hubris to believe not only that your death could mean more than your living, but that your death could mean more than death itself—which, because it is inevitable, means nothing.</p>
              <p>Cyrus prided himself in descending from people comfortable sitting in uncertainty. He himself knew little about anything and tried to remember that. He read once about a Sufi prayer that went “Lord, increase my bewilderment.” That was the prayer in its entirety.</p>
              <p>Painting saved me, but I can’t say I loved painting. I painted because I needed to. What I really loved, what I love, is having-painted. That was the high. Making something that would never have existed in the entirety of humanity had I not been there at that specific moment to make it.</p>
              <p>Do you have this organ here?” Cyrus asked her, pointing at the base of his throat. “A doom organ that just pulses all the time? Pulses dread, every day, obstinately? Like it thinks there’s a panther behind the curtain ready to maul you, but there’s no panther and it turns out there’s no curtain either? That’s what I wanted to stop.</p>
              <p>Where does all our effort go? It’s hard not to envy the monsters when you see how good they have it. And how unbothered they are at being monsters.</p>
              <p>Cyrus thought about what an aggressively human leader on earth might look like. One who, instead of defending decades-old obviously wrong positions, said, “Well, of course I changed my mind, I was presented with new information, that’s the definition of critical thinking.” That it seemed impossible to conceive of a political leader making such a statement made Cyrus mad, then sad.</p>
              <p>It’s easy for people who have sacrificed nothing to rationalize their own ordinariness by calling me lucky. But I sacrificed my entire life; I sold it to the abyss. And the abyss gave me art.</p>

              <h4> Classic story and case of men yearning tragically, and  stubbornly, for one woman in their lifetime and never again. The writing really pulls you in, and before I knew it, I'd finished the whole thing in one sitting. Madonna in a Fur Coat feels so gentle in many ways, the characters are deeply expressive and experience emotions so intensely that you can't help but feel it all alongside them. Beautiful.</h4>

              <h3>MY NOTES:</h3>
              <p>Only now did I begin to understand why it was not always through words that people sought each other out and came to understand each other, and why some poets went to such lengths to seek out companions who could, like them, contemplate the beauties of nature in silence.</p>
              <p>There are things – so many things – that I need to say ... but to whom? ... Can there be another soul wandering this great globe who is as lonely as I? Who would hear me out? Where would I begin?</p>
              <p>I was, in addition, absurdly shy, and therefore often mistaken for a fool, which upset me deeply. For nothing terrified me more than the prospect of correcting a false impression.</p>
              <p>From now on I would throw myself into my work, thereby freeing myself of the oppressive fears to which my idle life had condemned me.</p>
              <p>I'd feared wasting any happiness that came my way; I'd always wanted to save some of it for later. This had caused me to miss many opportunities. Even so, I'd always been reluctant to wish for more, lest I frighten away my good fortune.</p>
              <p>Of course, everyone else in the world was similarly endowed. But most would come into this world and leave it without even knowing what they had missed. A soul only came forward when it found its twin, when it felt no need to rely on mere words to explain itself … It was only then that we truly began to live – live with our soul.</p>
              <p>People can only get to know each other up to a point and then they make up the rest, until one day, seeing their mistake, they turn their backs on sadness and run away. Would this ever happen, if they stopped believing in their dreams and made do with what was possible? If everyone accepted what was natural, then no one would suffer disappointment, no one would curse fate. We have every right to see our situation as pitiful, but we must confine our pity to ourselves. To pity another is to assume superiority and that is why we must never think we are superior to others, or that others are more unfortunate.</p>
              <p>I’ve tried to be open and candid, even if it works against me, even if it works against others. But I am getting nowhere. Men and women have such a hard time understanding what we want from each other, and our emotions are so foggy that we hardly know what we are doing. We get lost in the current. I don’t want that. If I have to do things that seem to me to be unnecessary and unsatisfying, I end up hating myself … But what I hate most is women always having to be passive … Why? Why are we always the ones running away and you are the ones chasing after us? Why is it always that we surrender and you take the spoils? Why is it that even in the way you beg, there is dominance, and pity in the way we refuse? I’ve been challenging this since childhood. I’ve never accepted it, ever. Why am I like that? Why is it so important to me, when other women hardly seem to notice? I’ve thought about this a lot. I’ve often asked myself if I was abnormal. But no, on the contrary, I’ve come to think that I’m the normal one.</p>
              <p>Love is nothing like the simple compassion you describe, and neither is it a passion that comes and goes. It is something altogether different, something that defies analysis. And we are never to know where it comes from, or where it goes on the day it disappears. Whereas friendship is constant and built on understanding. We can see where it started and know why it falls apart. But love gives no reasons.</p>
              <p>If a person truly has the ability to love, then he can never monopolize his beloved. And neither can his beloved monopolize him. The more he spreads his love, the more he adores his one and only true love. When love spreads, it does not diminish.</p>
              <p>Having never known such intimacy before, I was desperate to protect it. And perhaps what I desired most was to possess her wholly and absolutely, body and soul, but I was so fearful of losing what I already had that I did not dare look away from it. I was, in effect, watching the most beautiful bird in all creation and keeping perfectly still for fear of frightening it away with a sudden movement.</p>
              <p>I would, for a few days, allow myself to be consoled. But then I would return to my deep-rooted conviction that this world had no use for me.</p>
              <p>Had someone asked me if my father had been a good man, I would have been at a loss for words. For I had never been close enough to know how good or bad he was. It was hard even to think of him as a real person: for me he had always been an abstract idea. A father. A bald man with a round grey beard who came home every evening in frowning silence. Who saw no reason why he should pay the slightest attention to his children, or to our mother.</p>
              <p>No matter where I was, I failed to make my presence felt. Opportunities abounded. Many different people gave me a fleeting hope that I might start my life over, drawing on my heart’s abundant reserves. But I just could not shake off my cynicism. There was only one person I’d ever believed in. I’d believed in her so deeply that – once deceived – I lost the will ever to believe in anyone again.</p>
              <p>But our missed opportunities never leave us, and every time they come back to haunt us, we ache. Or perhaps what haunts us is that nagging thought that things might have turned out differently. Because without that thought, we would put it down to fate and accept it.</p>
              <p>I lived almost like a convict, dragging myself from day to day. If I also treasured each passing day, it was because it took me closer to the end. I lived like a plant, unconscious and uncomplaining and without a will. Emotion was beyond me. I felt neither sadness nor joy.</p>

              <h4>"Angela doesn’t write, she moans." By pouring out longing, pain, and existence itself. A Breath of Life is a conversation between an Author and his creation, Angela Pralini, who exists only through his words yet takes on a life of her own. As the Author writes, he questions whether he is shaping Angela or if she is shaping him, blurring the boundary between creator and creation. It feels less like a novel and more like raw thoughts on desire, suffering, and what it means to be alive. Clarice Lispector was such an incredible writer, this book is mind blowingly intimate. This is also the last book Lispector ever wrote, published after her death from ovarian cancer. I enjoyed reading this book, and would love to read it again in a few years. </h4>
              <h3>MY NOTES:</h3>
              <p>Could I be betraying myself? Could I be altering the course of a river? I must trust that abundant river. Or maybe I'm damming a river? I try to open the flood-gates, I want to watch the water gushing out. I want every sentence of this book to be a climax.</p>
              <p>I must begin by accepting myself and not feeling the punitive horror of every time I fall, for when I fall the human race inside me falls too. To accept myself fully? that is a violation of my very life. Every change, every new project is scary: my heart is scared. And that is why each word of mine has a heart where blood flows.</p>
              <p>I've always wanted to find someday a person who would live for me because life is so full of useless things that I can only bear it through extreme muscular asthenia, I suffer from moral indolence in living.</p>
              <p>Could my fatal darkness be the promise of an also-fatal light? It so happens that I fear the fatal light and already have a certain intimacy with the dark.</p>
              <p>Do I love Angela, because she says what I don't have the courage to say because I am afraid of myself? or because I think speaking is useless? Because what you speak is lost like breath that leaves the mouth when you speak and that bit of breath is lost forever.</p>
              <p>When I think, I ruin everything. That's why I avoid thinking: all I really do is go on going on. And without questions about why or whither. If I think, a thing doesn't turn up, I don't happen.</p>
              <p>Angela has just made me suddenly feel something within and I felt happy. Extremely happy, I don't know why. Do I accept it? No, for some secret reason I feel a great burden of uneasiness and anxiety when I reach the snowy peak of a happiness-light. The too-purified air hurts my body.</p>
              <p>When I was a person, and not yet this rigorous being filled with words, I was more misunderstood by me. But I accepted myself as a whole. But the word slowly kept demystifying me and forcing me not to lie. I can still sometimes lie to others. But as for me my innocence ended and I am dealing more with an obscure reality that I nearly, nearly grasp. It's a secret truth, sealed, and I sometimes get lost in its fleeting aspect. I am only worthwhile as a discovery.</p>
              <p>I get along better with myself when I’m unhappy: a coming together takes place. When I’m happy, I feel like somebody else. Albeit another version of the same. Someone strangely joyful, whistling, slightly unhappy is more peaceful. I want so badly to be commonplace and a little vulgar and say: hope is the last to die.</p>
              <p>I try to keep myself isolated from the agony of depending on others, and that agony that seems to them a game of life and death masks another reality, a truth so extraordinary that they would keel over in fright were they to face it, as in a scandal.</p>
              <p>Why don’t people look at me when they speak? They always look at someone else. I resent it. But God looks me right in the pupils of my eyes. And I face him. He is my father-mother-mother-father. And I am they. I think I’ll see God very soon. It will be The Encounter. For I take risks.</p>
              <p>She’s always in a situation of at least semi-crisis.</p>
              <p>It’s so wonderful and comforting to meet someone at four. Four p.m. is the best time of day. Four p.m. gives you balance and a calm stability, a serene taste for living. At times almost a bit whizzing and “in tremolo.</p>
              <p>To get things started, let me assure you that you only live, real life, when you learn that even the lie is true. I decline to offer proof. But if someone insists on the “whys,” I’ll answer: the lie is born in the person who creates it and it brings into existence new lies from new truths.One word is the lie of another.I demandingly want you to believe me. I want you to believe me even when I lie.</p>
              <p>Why do I want to make a hero of myself? I in fact am anti-heroic. What torments me is that everything is “for the time being,” nothing is “always.” Life — from the moment you’re born — is guided, idealized by dreams. I plan nothing, I leap into the darkness and chew upon shadows, and in these shadows I sometimes see the luminous and pure sparkling of three inedible diamonds. So I rise to the surface with a diamond in each pupil of my eyes in order to pass through the opacity of the world and another between my half-closed lips so that when I speak my words will be crystalline, hard and dazzling.</p>
              <p>I want the shining gravel in the dark brook. I want the sparkle of the stone beneath the rays of sun, I want death that frees me. I could manage to have pleasure if I abstained from thinking.</p>
              <p>Reality doesn’t surprise me. But that’s not true: I suddenly feel such a hunger for the “thing to really happen” that I cry out and bite into reality with my lacerating teeth. And afterwards give a sigh over the captive whose flesh I ate. And again, for a long while, I do without real reality and find comfort in living from my imagination.</p>
              <p>The only thing that interests me is whatever cannot be thought — whatever can be thought is too little for me.</p>
              <p>Angela doesn’t write. She moans.</p>
              <p>Instead of saying “my world,” I say audaciously: the world depends on me. Because if I don’t exist, the Universe ceases within me. Could it be that abstraction begins after death?</p>
              <p>Living is a hobby for her. She thinks it has nothing to do with her and lives tossed to the side, without past or future; just today forever.</p>
              <p>There is a total silence within me. I get scared. How to explain that this silence is what I call the Unknown. I’m afraid of It. Not because It could childishly punish me (punishment is something people do). The fear comes from what surpasses me. And that also is me. Because my greatness is great.</p>
              <p>But I have to love myself the way I involuntarily am.</p>
              <p>For I bathe entirely in that devouring darkness, I want to know the depth of my hatred. I want to know every feeling. Must a person have experienced this cursed power in order to be a complete person? I don’t know, but it’s demonic.</p>
              <p>When I say I love you, I am loving me in you.I’m not relative I’m infinite that’s why in each being I reflect myself in each being I encounter myself.</p>
              <p>I want to show myself the dirtiest and lowest part of me — and only then can I forgive myself. I want to be forgiven for being so full of sensuality that it is an animal cry inside me, a taste of the harsh voice of the wolf desiring its prey, me! I who aspire to the great disorder of vile desires and the darkness that possesses me in the apocalyptic orgasm of my existence. My existence is the victim of a fatality. That is: I am, oh poor me human and weak and needy and begging. I want your smile, I want your velvet caress, I want the body-to-body struggle, both so intimate, so gullible lost children.</p>
              <p>The forgetting of things is my escape valve. I forget a lot out of necessity. I’m even trying and succeeding in forgetting me, me minutes before, I forget my future. I’m naked.</p>

              <h4>It’s a quiet book. Nothing really happens, and there isn’t much of a plot. I generally don’t gravitate toward books like these, but Jansson’s writing is subtle yet vivid. I was surprised to learn it was published in 1972, as it feels quite modern. Reading it in March made me look forward to the quietness of summer. I'm not sure why, but this book carries a sense of nostalgia for me.</h4>

              <h4>It mostly follows Sophia, a six-year-old girl, and her Grandmother, who remains unnamed. Their companionship is tender and has a quiet understanding that feels deeply real. Sophia’s characterization is as natural as I would expect a child’s to be, curious and dramatic. Even the smallest moments feel significant. It’s a book that doesn’t demand much from the reader.</h4>

              <h3>MY NOTES:</h3>
              <p>Sophia picked some flowers and held them in her hand until they got warm and unpleasant; then she put them down on her grandmother and asked how God could keep track of all the people who prayed at the same time.</p>
              <p>"It's funny about love," Sophia said. "The more you love someone, the less he likes you back." "That's very true," Grandmother observed. "And so what do you do?" "You go on loving," said Sophia threateningly, "You love harder and harder."</p>
              <p>It is still summer, but the summer is no longer alive. It has come to a standstill; nothing withers, and fall is not ready to begin. There are no stars yet, just darkness.</p>
              <p>The thing about God, she thought, is that He usually does help, but not until you've made an effort on your own.</p>
              <p>Gathering is peculiar, because you see nothing but what you're looking for. If you're picking raspberries, you see only what's red, and if you're looking for bones you see only the white. No matter where you go, the only thing you see is bones.</p>
              <p>She started thinking about all the euphemisms for death, all the anxious taboos that had always fascinated her. It was too bad you could never have an intelligent discussion on the subject. People were either too young or too old, or else they didn't have time.</p>
              <p>Wise as she was, she realized that people can postpone their rebellious phases until they're eighty-five years old, and she decided to keep an eye on herself.</p>
              <p>There is nothing sentimental about this world. Like the weather, this world asks only to be acknowledged. There is nothing comforting about it, and yet if you are afraid to see it in its own terms and look to it for comfort, for solace, you will be left worse off than you were before.</p>
